# Task: Detect Squad Context

**Task ID:** detect-squad-context
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Execution Type:** Hybrid (Script-first detection + Agent interpretation only for ambiguity)
**Purpose:** Detect the right creation or upgrade route before any squad generation begins
**Orchestrator:** @squad-chief
**Mode:** Automatic with conditional elicitation

## Core Principle

```
Wrong context selection creates wrong architecture.
Detect first, then build.
```

## Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `domain` | string | Yes | Domain to create/upgrade |
| `squad_name` | string | No | Existing or desired squad slug |
| `intent` | enum | No | `create`, `upgrade`, `unsure` |

---

## Context Categories

```yaml
contexts:
  greenfield_pure:
    signal: "No existing squad and no prior artifacts"
    action: "Run greenfield creation workflow"

  pre_existing_brief:
    signal: "PRD/brief exists but squad folder is missing or partial"
    action: "Create using brief as source of truth"

  legacy_assets:
    signal: "Squad exists with assets but missing current standards"
    action: "Route to brownfield upgrade workflow"

  partial_squad:
    signal: "Squad exists with incomplete structure"
    action: "Resume creation with gap fill"
```

---

## Detection Flow

1. Check `squads/{squad_name}/` existence.
2. Check presence of `config.yaml`, `agents/`, `tasks/`, `workflows/`.
3. Scan for PRD/brief references in `docs/` and `outputs/`.
4. Build confidence score per context.
5. If confidence < 0.70, ask user with 3 options.

---

## Outputs

```yaml
context_detection:
  detected_context: greenfield_pure | pre_existing_brief | legacy_assets | partial_squad
  confidence: 0.0-1.0
  recommended_workflow: wf-context-aware-create-squad | wf-brownfield-upgrade-squad
  evidence:
    - file_or_signal: "..."
      impact: "..."
  next_action: "..."
```

---

## Validation

- Context assigned with confidence >= 0.70, or user-confirmed.
- Recommended workflow exists and is executable.
- Decision evidence saved in logs.
