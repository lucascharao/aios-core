# Agent Merged: aios-orchestrator → aios-master

**NOTICE:** This agent has been merged into aios-master.

## New Agent Name
**@aios-master** - Orion (Orchestrator)

## Backward Compatibility
This file serves as a redirect for backward compatibility.

**Old name:** `@aios-orchestrator`
**New name:** `@aios-master`

## Why the Merge?
- aios-developer and aios-orchestrator had overlapping functionality
- Users were confused about which agent to activate
- Single unified agent (aios-master) is simpler and more powerful
- All commands from both agents are now available in aios-master

## What Changed?
- **All commands preserved:** workflow, plan, chat-mode, status, etc.
- **Enhanced capabilities:** Now includes framework component creation
- **Unified identity:** Orion (Orchestrator) persona retained with expanded role

## Usage
Please use **@aios-master** going forward for:
- Workflow orchestration and coordination
- Multi-agent task planning
- Framework component creation
- Any master-level operations

This redirect will be maintained for backward compatibility during the transition period.
