# Agent Renamed: github-devops → devops

**NOTICE:** This agent has been renamed to better reflect its scope.

## New Agent Name
**@devops** - Gage (Operator)

## Backward Compatibility
This file serves as a redirect for backward compatibility.

**Old name:** `@github-devops`
**New name:** `@devops`

## Why the Change?
- "github-devops" too specific (agent handles all DevOps, not just GitHub)
- Persona definition specifies "Gage the DevOps Operator"
- "devops" is the canonical industry term
- Shorter @mention (@devops vs @github-devops)

## Usage
Please use **@devops** going forward. This redirect will be maintained for backward compatibility during the transition period.

For the agent definition, see: `devops.md`
